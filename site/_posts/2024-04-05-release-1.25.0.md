Avatica 1.25.0 is a routine release featuring support for JDK 21, Gradle 8.5 and several bug fixes.

*Breaking Change*: Due to [<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-6282">CALCITE-6282</a>] and
[<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-6248">CALCITE-6248</a>], illegal dates are no longer
accepted by casts and time precision will not be ignored when returning TIME results, respectively. If you are relying
on this behavior, your applications may break.

See the list of
[bug fixes and new features]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/history.html#v1-25-0)
for more information.
